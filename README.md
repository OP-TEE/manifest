# Repo manifest for OP-TEE development
This git contains repo manifests to be able to clone all source code needed to
be able to setup a full OP-TEE developer build.

All official OP-TEE documentation has moved to http://optee.readthedocs.io. The
information that used to be here in this git can be found under [manifests].
